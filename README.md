Task 7 of GRIP internship tilted on stock price prediction
Project Title: Stock Price Prediction with Sentiment Analysis

Project Description:

I led a data-driven project focused on predicting stock price movements by combining numerical analysis of historical stock prices with sentiment analysis of news headlines. This project integrated quantitative and qualitative data sources to generate predictive insights for investment decisions.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Data Collection: Gathered historical stock price data for selected stocks and indices, spanning multiple time intervals (daily, hourly, and minute-by-minute). Collected relevant news headlines from credible sources using web scraping techniques and APIs.

Feature Engineering: Engineered a wide range of features from the stock price data, including moving averages, trading volumes, and relative strength indices (RSI). Prepared the news headlines by performing text preprocessing, tokenization, and sentiment analysis to obtain sentiment scores for each headline.

Model Development: Selected and implemented machine learning and statistical models for stock price prediction. This involved data splitting, model training, and parameter tuning. Integrated the engineered features and sentiment scores to create a hybrid predictive model.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and classification metrics for directional predictions (e.g., up or down). Conducted thorough backtesting to assess the historical performance of the model.

Risk Management: Implemented risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses, including setting stop-loss levels and portfolio diversification.

Continuous Improvement: Maintained and updated the model with new data to adapt to changing market conditions and news sentiment. Made refinements based on model performance and market feedback.

Results: The project provided valuable insights for making informed investment decisions. The integrated model's predictions were used for backtesting trading strategies, and the project contributed to enhancing decision-making processes.

User Interface: Developed a user-friendly interface for accessing predictions and insights, providing a user-friendly experience for project stakeholders.

This project showcased my ability to work with complex financial data, employ machine learning and NLP techniques, and integrate diverse data sources to solve real-world problems in the finance domain. It demonstrated my skills in data analysis, modeling, and effective communication of results to support informed investment strategies.
